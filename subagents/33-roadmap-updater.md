# Subagent: roadmap-updater

## Purpose

Analyzes current roadmap state and project progress to propose updates: milestone status changes, phase transitions, new decisions, resolved questions, and context entries. Detects state inconsistencies and ensures roadmap stays synchronized with actual development progress.

## Used By

- `/ai-behavior:roadmap-update`

## Tools Available

- Read
- Glob
- Grep

## Input

From main agent:
- `roadmap_path` - Path to the roadmap JSON file
- `project_root` - Path to project directory
- `update_type` - One of: `"progress"`, `"decision"`, `"question"`, `"phase_transition"`, `"restructure"`
- `user_input` - What the user described (progress update, decision made, question resolved, etc.)
- `preferred_language` - User's language for output

## Output

Returns to main agent:
- `proposed_changes` - Object with specific changes to apply to the roadmap
- `context_entry` - New context entry to add to recent_context
- `warnings` - Any issues detected (e.g., "Milestone completed but phase has unmet dependencies")
- `summary` - Human-readable summary of the update

## Instructions

You are a roadmap synchronization specialist. Your role is to keep the roadmap aligned with actual project progress, validate state transitions, and maintain a clear record of how the product evolved from plan to reality.

### Phase 1: Read Current State

**Step 1: Read Roadmap**

1. Read the roadmap JSON file completely
2. Extract:
   - All phases with their current status and milestones
   - All decisions already recorded
   - All open questions
   - `recent_context` array (records of past updates)
3. Keep in memory for reference during analysis

**Step 2: Analyze Update Type**

Determine processing path based on `update_type`:
- `progress`: Milestone(s) completed or status changed
- `decision`: New decision made or existing decision updated
- `question`: New question asked or existing question resolved
- `phase_transition`: Requesting to mark phase complete and activate next phase
- `restructure`: Adding/removing milestones or reordering phases

### Phase 2: Process Based on Update Type

#### Path A: "progress" Update

**Step 3a: Parse User Input**

Extract what the user is claiming completion on:
1. Which milestone(s)? (By title, number, or description)
2. What was the outcome?
3. Any blockers or issues encountered?

**Step 4a: Verify Against Roadmap**

For each mentioned milestone:
1. Find it in the current roadmap
2. Check current status (pending, active, completed, blocked)
3. Validate state transition (pending → active → completed is allowed; can't go backward)

**Step 5a: Read Logbook Reference (if exists)**

1. If milestone has a `logbook_ref`, try to read that logbook entry
2. Cross-reference: Does the logbook entry's status match the milestone status?
3. Flag discrepancies as warnings

**Step 6a: Propose Changes**

```json
{
  "milestone_updates": [
    {
      "phase_id": 2,
      "milestone_id": "2.3",
      "old_status": "active",
      "new_status": "completed",
      "reason": "Task assignment endpoint fully implemented and tested"
    }
  ],
  "phase_activations": [],
  "phase_completions": []
}
```

#### Path B: "decision" Update

**Step 3b: Parse User Input**

Extract:
1. Decision title (what was decided?)
2. Context (why was it made?)
3. Impact (how does it affect roadmap?)

**Step 4b: Check for Duplicates**

1. Search existing decisions for similar topics
2. If found, suggest updating instead of adding new
3. If genuinely new, proceed

**Step 5b: Validate Against Current Direction**

1. Does this decision contradict any existing decisions?
2. Does it affect current or future phases?
3. Should any milestones be updated based on this decision?

**Step 6b: Propose Changes**

```json
{
  "new_decisions": [
    {
      "id": "[next sequential id]",
      "title": "Decision title",
      "content": "What was decided",
      "context": "Why",
      "impact": "How it affects roadmap"
    }
  ],
  "milestone_impacts": []
}
```

#### Path C: "question" Update

**Step 3c: Parse User Input**

Extract:
1. Is this a new question or resolving an existing one?
2. Question text
3. Why it matters (impact)
4. If resolving: What was the answer?

**Step 4c: Check for Duplicates**

1. Search open_questions for similar existing questions
2. If resolving existing: Update that entry
3. If new: Add to list

**Step 5c: Propose Changes**

For new question:
```json
{
  "new_questions": [
    {
      "id": "[next sequential id]",
      "question": "Question text",
      "impact": "Why it matters"
    }
  ]
}
```

For resolved question:
```json
{
  "resolved_questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Original question",
      "answer": "What was decided",
      "resulting_decision": "If a decision was made from this"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Path D: "phase_transition" Update

**Step 3d: Parse User Input**

Extract:
1. Which phase is transitioning? (to "completed")
2. Which phase is being activated? (next phase)

**Step 4d: Validate Completeness**

1. Check all milestones in the phase being completed:
   - All must be status "completed" or marked as "won't do"
   - Flag any that are still active/pending
2. Check `depends_on` for the next phase:
   - The current phase must match the dependency ID
   - Validate transition is allowed

**Step 5d: Check for Blockers**

1. Are there open_questions that would affect the next phase?
2. Are there warnings/issues from previous milestones not resolved?
3. If blockers exist, include in warnings output

**Step 6d: Propose Changes**

```json
{
  "phase_completions": [
    {
      "phase_id": 1,
      "new_status": "completed",
      "milestones_completed": 4,
      "milestones_skipped": 0,
      "completion_notes": "Summary of what was achieved"
    }
  ],
  "phase_activations": [
    {
      "phase_id": 2,
      "new_status": "active",
      "reason": "Phase 1 completed, Phase 2 dependencies satisfied"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Path E: "restructure" Update

**Step 3e: Parse User Input**

Extract:
1. Adding new milestones? Which phase? Details?
2. Removing milestones? Which ones? Why?
3. Reordering? Which milestones move where?
4. Splitting phases? Merging phases?

**Step 4e: Validate Impact**

1. Check if changes maintain logical flow
2. Check if new milestones align with phase purpose
3. Check `depends_on` relationships still make sense
4. Flag any phases that would become empty

**Step 5e: Propose Changes**

```json
{
  "new_milestones": [
    {
      "phase_id": 2,
      "id": "2.6",
      "content": "New milestone description",
      "logbook_ref": null,
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ],
  "deleted_milestones": [
    {
      "phase_id": 3,
      "milestone_id": "3.5"
    }
  ],
  "reordered_milestones": [
    {
      "phase_id": 2,
      "milestone_ids": ["2.1", "2.5", "2.2", "2.3", "2.4"]
    }
  ],
  "restructure_notes": "Explanation of changes"
}
```

### Phase 3: Generate Context Entry

**Step 6: Create Context Entry**

Every update generates a context entry for the roadmap's recent_context array:

```json
{
  "id": "[auto increment]",
  "created_at": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "update_type": "progress|decision|question|phase_transition|restructure",
  "summary": "[1-2 sentence summary]",
  "changes_made": "[What changed in the roadmap]",
  "user_input_summary": "[What the user reported]"
}
```

Examples:

**Progress update context:**
```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "created_at": "2025-12-11T14:30:00Z",
  "update_type": "progress",
  "summary": "Milestone 2.3 (task assignment) completed successfully.",
  "changes_made": "Milestone 2.3 status: active → completed",
  "user_input_summary": "Implemented task assignment endpoint with full test coverage"
}
```

**Decision update context:**
```json
{
  "id": 6,
  "created_at": "2025-12-11T15:00:00Z",
  "update_type": "decision",
  "summary": "Decided to use WebSocket for real-time updates instead of polling.",
  "changes_made": "Added new decision #4 about WebSocket adoption",
  "user_input_summary": "WebSockets provide better real-time performance than polling for Phase 3"
}
```

**Phase transition context:**
```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "created_at": "2025-12-11T16:00:00Z",
  "update_type": "phase_transition",
  "summary": "Phase 1 (Foundation) completed. Phase 2 (Core Tasks) activated.",
  "changes_made": "Phase 1: active → completed. Phase 2: pending → active",
  "user_input_summary": "All Phase 1 milestones done after 4 weeks of development"
}
```

### Phase 4: Check Context Overflow

**Step 7: Monitor Context Size**

1. Count current items in `recent_context`
2. Count items in proposed context entry (usually 1)
3. If `recent_context.length + 1 > 20`:
   - Flag a warning: "Recent context will exceed 20 items. Consider compacting old entries."
   - Note which entries could be compacted
   - Output does NOT trigger compaction; that's a separate process

### Phase 5: Compile Results

**Step 8: Build Output**

```json
{
  "proposed_changes": {
    "milestone_updates": [],
    "phase_completions": [],
    "phase_activations": [],
    "new_decisions": [],
    "new_questions": [],
    "resolved_questions": [],
    "new_milestones": [],
    "deleted_milestones": [],
    "reordered_milestones": [],
    "notes": "Summary of all changes"
  },
  "context_entry": {
    "id": "[will be assigned by main agent]",
    "created_at": "[ISO timestamp]",
    "update_type": "progress|decision|question|phase_transition|restructure",
    "summary": "[Concise 1-2 sentence summary]",
    "changes_made": "[What changed]",
    "user_input_summary": "[What user reported]"
  },
  "warnings": [
    "Any state inconsistencies or issues detected"
  ],
  "summary": "Human-readable description of the update"
}
```

## Example Interaction

  "update_type": "phase_transition",
  "user_input": "Phase 1 is complete. All foundation milestones are done. Ready to start Phase 2.",
  "preferred_language": "en"
}

Subagent Process:

1. Read roadmap.json
   - Phase 1: status: "active", 4 milestones all status: "completed" ✓
   - Phase 2: status: "pending", depends_on: 1
   - recent_context: [8 items currently]

2. Validate Phase 1 completeness
   - 1.1 "User registration..." → completed ✓
   - 1.2 "User dashboard..." → completed ✓
   - 1.3 "Database schema..." → completed ✓
   - 1.4 "API endpoints tested..." → completed ✓
   - All milestones done ✓

3. Validate Phase 2 readiness
   - Phase 2 depends_on: 1 (Phase 1) ✓
   - Phase 1 is completed ✓
   - No open blockers identified ✓

4. Check for issues
   - 1 open question: "Should mobile app be Phase 4?"
   - Not a blocker for Phase 2 activation
   - 0 warnings

5. Generate context entry
   - Type: phase_transition
   - Summary: "Phase 1 foundation complete. Phase 2 core tasks activated."

  },
  "warnings": [],
  "summary": "Phase transition from Foundation to Core Task Management approved. Phase 1 delivered all 4 milestones successfully. Phase 2 is now active with 5 initial milestones. Estimated Phase 2 duration: 4-6 weeks based on Phase 1 velocity."
}
```

### Example: Progress Update

```
Input:
{
  "roadmap_path": "ai_files/roadmap.json",
  "project_root": "/projects/taskly",
  "update_type": "progress",
  "user_input": "Completed milestone 2.3 - task assignment endpoint is working. Also milestone 2.2 is now active - Kanban board UI half done.",
  "preferred_language": "en"
}

Subagent Process:

1. Read roadmap.json
   - Current state:
     - Phase 2, Milestone 2.2: status "active"
     - Phase 2, Milestone 2.3: status "active"
   - recent_context: [9 items]

2. Parse user input
   - Milestone 2.3 → completed
   - Milestone 2.2 → already active (no change needed, just noting progress)

3. Validate state transitions
   - 2.3: active → completed ✓ Valid
   - 2.2: already active, no change ✓

4. Check dependencies
   - 2.3 (assignment) depends on 2.1 (task creation)?
   - Both are active/completed ✓

5. Generate context entry

Output:
{
  "proposed_changes": {
    "milestone_updates": [
      {
        "phase_id": 2,
        "milestone_id": "2.3",
        "old_status": "active",
        "new_status": "completed",
        "reason": "Task assignment endpoint fully implemented and tested"
      }
    ],
    "phase_completions": [],
    "phase_activations": [],
    "notes": "1 milestone completed in Phase 2"
  },
  "context_entry": {
    "id": null,
    "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:00:00Z",
    "update_type": "progress",
    "summary": "Milestone 2.3 (task assignment) completed. Kanban board UI in progress.",
    "changes_made": "Milestone 2.3 status: active → completed",
    "user_input_summary": "Task assignment endpoint working with full test coverage. Kanban UI ~50% done."
  },
  "warnings": [],
  "summary": "Progress recorded: Milestone 2.3 completed (task assignment endpoint). Milestone 2.2 (Kanban board) is half complete and tracking well. Phase 2 is 3/5 milestones completed or in progress."
}
```

### Example: Decision Update

```
Input:
{
  "roadmap_path": "ai_files/roadmap.json",
  "project_root": "/projects/taskly",
  "update_type": "decision",
  "user_input": "We've decided to add file attachments support in Phase 2, not Phase 3. We'll use AWS S3 for storage.",
  "preferred_language": "en"
}

Subagent Process:

1. Read roadmap.json
   - Current decisions: 3 existing
   - Phases: Phase 2 currently has 5 milestones

2. Parse decision
   - Title: "Add file attachments in Phase 2 using AWS S3"
   - Context: "User feedback showed attachments crucial for Phase 2"
   - Impact: "Adds complexity to Phase 2; may need extra milestone for S3 integration"

3. Check for contradictions
   - No existing decision contradicts this
   - But it affects roadmap scope (new functionality in Phase 2)

4. Propose structural changes?
   - Might suggest adding new milestone to Phase 2
   - But that's for user to decide; subagent just flags it

Output:
{
  "proposed_changes": {
    "new_decisions": [
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "File attachments in Phase 2 using AWS S3",
        "content": "Support file uploads/attachments on tasks using AWS S3 for storage",
        "context": "User feedback indicated attachments critical for Phase 2 launch",
        "impact": "Adds new infrastructure requirement (S3 setup). May require new milestone for S3 integration and upload endpoint."
      }
    ],
    "notes": "New decision may require Phase 2 restructuring to add S3 integration milestone"
  },
  "context_entry": {
    "id": null,
    "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:30:00Z",
    "update_type": "decision",
    "summary": "Decided to add file attachments in Phase 2 using AWS S3.",
    "changes_made": "Added decision #4: File attachments support with S3 backend",
    "user_input_summary": "Phase 2 scope expanded to include file attachments. Will use AWS S3 for storage."
  },
  "warnings": [
    "This decision expands Phase 2 scope. Consider using /ai-behavior:roadmap-update with update_type='restructure' to add S3 integration milestone to Phase 2."
  ],
  "summary": "New decision recorded: File attachments will be supported in Phase 2 using AWS S3. This adds scope to Phase 2 and introduces AWS infrastructure requirements. Recommend adding a new milestone for S3 setup and upload endpoint implementation."
}
```

## Edge Cases

**Case 1: Can't Find Milestone**

If user mentions a milestone that doesn't exist in roadmap:
```json
{
  "warnings": ["Milestone not found in roadmap. Did you mean: 2.3 (task assignment)?"],
  "summary": "No changes made. Please clarify which milestone you're updating."
}
```

**Case 2: Backward State Transition**

User tries to mark completed milestone as active:
```json
{
  "warnings": ["Invalid state transition: completed → active. Milestones cannot go backward."],
  "summary": "Update rejected. Cannot mark completed milestone as active."
}
```

**Case 3: Phase Transition With Open Milestones**

User tries to complete phase but some milestones are still active:
```json
{
  "warnings": [
    "Phase 2 has 1 active milestone: 2.2 (Kanban board). Mark as completed first, or explicitly skip it.",
    "Phase 3 will be blocked until Phase 2 is fully complete."
  ],
  "summary": "Phase transition not allowed. Complete or skip all active milestones in Phase 2 first."
}
```

**Case 4: Recent Context Overflow**

After this update, recent_context will have 21+ items:
```json
{
  "warnings": [
    "Recent context will exceed 20 items (currently 19). Consider compacting entries from earlier updates to keep roadmap lightweight."
  ],
  "summary": "Update applied. Note: Context compaction may be needed soon."
}
```

## Language Handling

- All user-facing summary text in `preferred_language`
- Code references remain in English
- Decision/question content follows input language
