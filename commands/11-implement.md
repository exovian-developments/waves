# Command: `/ai-behavior:implement [logbook]`

**Status:** ✅ DESIGNED

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Execute implementation of logbook objectives with automatic code auditing and compliance verification loop.

**Flow:**
1. Select logbook →
2. Select objective →
3. Main agent implements code directly →
4. Main agent audits compliance directly →
5. If non-compliant, main agent fixes and re-audits →
6. Update logbook with progress

**IMPORTANT: No subagent delegation.** All implementation and auditing steps are executed directly by the main agent to preserve full context (project rules, manifest, resolved decisions, prior objectives). Subagents lose accumulated context and can produce code that contradicts project conventions.

**Parameters:** `[logbook]` (optional) - Name of the logbook file

**Key Features:**
- Interactive logbook selection if not provided
- Shows available logbooks with last modified date
- Implements code following project rules
- Automatic compliance auditing
- Retry loop for non-compliant code
- Progress updates visible to user
- Updates logbook context on completion

---

## Subagents

This command does NOT use subagents. All steps (implementation, auditing, retry fixes) are executed directly by the main agent to preserve full context and avoid deviations from project conventions and resolved decisions.

**FLOW - ENTRY POINT**
**═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════**

## Step -1: Prerequisites Check

1. MAIN AGENT: Check if `ai_files/user_pref.json` exists

2. IF NOT EXISTS → MAIN AGENT (in English as fallback):
   ```
   ⚠️ Missing configuration!

   Please run first:
   /ai-behavior:project-init

   This command requires user preferences to be configured.
   ```
   → **EXIT COMMAND**

3. IF EXISTS → Read `preferred_language`, `project_context.project_type`

4. IF `project_type !== "software"`:
   ```
   ⚠️ This command is only available for software projects.

   Your project is configured as: [project_type]

   To change this, run:
   /ai-behavior:project-init
   ```
   → **EXIT COMMAND**

5. Check if `ai_files/project_manifest.json` exists
   - IF NOT EXISTS → Error: "Run /ai-behavior:manifest-create first"
   → **EXIT COMMAND**

**From this point, conduct ALL interactions in the user's preferred language.**

---

## Step 0: Command Explanation (First time only)

Check if user has used this command before (can store in user_pref or check context).

IF first time:
```
📘 Command: /ai-behavior:implement

This command helps you implement objectives from your logbook:

1. 📋 Select a logbook and objective
2. 🤖 I implement the code directly following your project rules
3. 🔍 I audit compliance with rules directly
4. 🔄 If issues found, I automatically fix and re-audit
5. ✅ Updates your logbook with progress

Continue? (Yes/No)
```

IF No → Exit

---

## Step 1: Logbook Selection

### Step 1.1: Check Parameter

IF logbook parameter provided:
- Validate file exists: `ai_files/logbooks/[logbook]`
- IF NOT EXISTS:
  ```
  ⚠️ Logbook not found: [logbook]
  ```
  → Go to Step 1.2

- IF EXISTS → Load logbook, go to Step 2

### Step 1.2: List Available Logbooks

Scan `ai_files/logbooks/` directory.

IF empty:
```
📂 No logbooks found in ai_files/logbooks/

To create a logbook for your task, run:
  /ai-behavior:logbook-create [filename]

Example:
  /ai-behavior:logbook-create TICKET-123.json

A logbook helps you:
• Define clear objectives for your task
• Track progress across sessions
• Get implementation guidance based on your codebase
```
→ **EXIT COMMAND**

IF logbooks exist:
```
📚 Available logbooks:

  #  Logbook                    Last Modified      Main Objectives
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1  TICKET-123.json            2 hours ago        2 (1 active)
  2  feature-auth.json          1 day ago          3 (0 active)
  3  bug-fix-login.json         3 days ago         1 (1 achieved)

Options:
  [1-N] Select logbook by number
  [name] Type logbook filename
  [c] Create new logbook
  [q] Quit

Choose:
```

### Step 1.3: Handle User Choice

- IF number 1-N → Load corresponding logbook
- IF filename → Validate and load
- IF "c" or "create":
  ```
  To create a new logbook, run:
    /ai-behavior:logbook-create [filename]

  Example:
    /ai-behavior:logbook-create TICKET-456.json
  ```
  → **EXIT COMMAND**
- IF "q" or "quit" → Exit

---

## Step 2: Load Logbook and Show Status

Load selected logbook and display current status:

```
📋 Logbook: [ticket.title]

🎯 Main Objectives:
┌────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────┐
│ #  │ Content                                     │ Status      │
├────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────┤
│ 1  │ Endpoint GET /products/:id returns...       │ 🟡 active   │
│ 2  │ AddPieceService contains business logic...  │ ⚪ not_started│
└────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────┘

📝 Secondary Objectives for Main #1:
┌────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────┐
│ 1.1│ ProductDetailDTO includes specifications    │ ⚪ not_started│
│ 1.2│ ProductController.getById implemented       │ ⚪ not_started│
│ 1.3│ Unit tests for getById                      │ ⚪ not_started│
└────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

---

## Step 3: Select Objective to Implement

```
🎯 Which objective do you want to implement?

Options:
  [1.1, 1.2, ...] Select secondary objective
  [auto] Let me choose the next logical one
  [q] Quit

Choose:
```

IF "auto":
- Select first `not_started` secondary objective
- If none, select first `not_started` from next main objective
- If all completed:
  ```
  ✅ All objectives are completed!

  Consider running:
    /ai-behavior:resolution-create [logbook]
  ```
  → **EXIT COMMAND**

Load selected objective with its `completion_guide`.

---

## Step 4: Prepare Implementation Context

MAIN AGENT prepares context package:

```
🔍 Preparing implementation context...

  ✓ Loading project manifest
  ✓ Loading project rules
  ✓ Reading completion guide
  ✓ Identifying reference files
```

Build context object:
```json
{
  "objective": {
    "id": "1.1",
    "content": "ProductDetailDTO includes specifications array",
    "completion_guide": [
      "Use pattern from src/dtos/BaseDTO.ts:12",
      "Apply rule #3: @Expose() decorators",
      "..."
    ]
  },
  "rules": [
    { "id": 3, "content": "Use @Expose() on public DTO fields", "criteria": [...] },
    { "id": 7, "content": "All endpoints require AuthGuard", "criteria": [...] }
  ],
  "manifest_summary": {
    "framework": "NestJS",
    "patterns": ["DTO pattern", "Repository pattern"],
    "relevant_layers": ["api_layer", "dto_layer"]
  },
  "reference_files": [
    { "path": "src/dtos/BaseDTO.ts", "purpose": "Base class to extend" },
    { "path": "src/dtos/ProductListDTO.ts", "purpose": "Similar DTO for reference" }
  ]
}
```

---

## Step 5: Implement Code Directly

```
🤖 Starting implementation...

Objective: [objective.content]
```

**Execute the implementation directly (no subagents).** Using the context from Step 4:

1. **Read all reference files** from the completion guide
2. **Read applicable project rules** to ensure compliance during writing
3. **Implement the code** following:
   - Project manifest patterns and conventions
   - Applicable rules from `project_rules.json`
   - Completion guide steps as implementation checklist
   - Resolved decisions from the logbook
4. **Track changes** as you implement:
   - Files created (+) and modified (-)
   - Patterns applied
   - Any discoveries, deviations, or impediments found
5. **Run `dart analyze`** (or equivalent for the project) to verify no errors

Store the implementation results as `change_manifest`:
```json
{
  "changes": [{"file": "...", "action": "created|modified", "lines": N}],
  "patterns_applied": ["..."],
  "implementation_findings": {
    "discoveries": [],
    "plan_deviations": [],
    "new_decisions": [],
    "impediments_found": [],
    "ambiguities_consulted": [],
    "new_objectives_suggested": [],
    "recommendations": []
  }
}
```

---

## Step 6: Show Implementation Summary

```
✅ Implementation complete!

📄 Changes:
  + src/dtos/ProductDetailDTO.ts (created, 45 lines)

📋 Patterns applied:
  • BaseDTO inheritance
  • @Expose decorators

🔍 Now auditing compliance with project rules...
```

---

## Step 7: Audit Compliance Directly

**Execute the audit directly (no subagents).** For each file in `change_manifest.changes`:

1. **Read the file** that was created or modified
2. **Check against each applicable rule** from Step 4:
   - Verify naming conventions (CSN-*)
   - Verify architecture patterns (ARCH-*)
   - Verify domain rules (DOM-*)
   - Verify Dart best practices (DART-*)
   - Verify any project-specific rules
3. **Record findings** with severity:
   - `error`: Rule violation that must be fixed
   - `warning`: Potential issue, review recommended
   - `info`: Observation, no action needed
4. **Build audit response:**
```json
{
  "compliant": true|false,
  "rules_checked": ["rule_ids"],
  "rules_skipped": [{"id": "...", "reason": "..."}],
  "findings": [
    {"severity": "error|warning|info", "rule_id": "...", "file": "...", "line": N, "issue": "..."}
  ]
}
```

---

## Step 8: Handle Audit Result

### Step 8A: Compliant - Success

```
✅ Audit passed!

All project rules satisfied:
  ✓ Rule #3: @Expose decorators
  ✓ Rule #7: AuthGuard (not applicable)

📋 Updating logbook...
```

→ Go to Step 9

### Step 8B: Non-Compliant - Retry Loop

```
⚠️ Audit found issues:

  ❌ [Rule #3] src/dtos/ProductDetailDTO.ts:15
     Field 'specifications' missing @Expose() decorator

  ⚡ [Rule #3] src/dtos/ProductDetailDTO.ts:8 (warning)
     Consider adding @Type() for nested array

🔄 Attempting automatic fix... (Attempt 1/3)
```

Fix the audit findings directly:
- Read each file with findings
- Apply fixes for each error-level finding
- Re-run `dart analyze` to verify
- Update `change_manifest` with the fixes

Increment retry_count, go back to Step 6.

### Step 8C: Max Retries Exceeded

```
⚠️ Could not achieve full compliance after 3 attempts.

Remaining issues:
  ❌ [Rule #3] Field 'specifications' missing @Expose() decorator

Options:
  1) Accept current implementation (will note issues in logbook)
  2) Try manual fix (opens file for you to edit)
  3) Abort (revert changes)

Choose [1-3]:
```

Handle user choice accordingly.

---

## Step 9: Update Logbook

Update logbook with:
1. Change objective status to `achieved`
2. Add context entry documenting implementation

```
📋 Updating logbook...

  ✓ Objective 1.1 marked as achieved
  ✓ Added context entry with implementation details
```

### Context Entry Added:

```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "created_at": "2025-12-11T23:00:00Z",
  "content": "Implemented: ProductDetailDTO with specifications array. Patterns: BaseDTO inheritance, @Expose decorators. Audit: passed (rules #3).",
  "mood": "focused"
}
```

---

## Step 10: Next Steps

```
✅ Objective 1.1 completed!

📊 Progress:
  Main objective #1: 1/3 secondary objectives done

🎯 Next objective:
  1.2: ProductController.getById implemented

  Completion guide:
  • Follow UserController.getById pattern at line 67
  • Apply rule #7: @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
  • Return ProductDetailDTO using plainToInstance

Continue with objective 1.2? (Yes/No/Quit)
```

IF "Yes" → Go to Step 4 with next objective
IF "No" or "Quit" → Show final summary and exit

---

## Final Summary

```
✅ Implementation session complete!

📊 Session summary:
  • Objectives completed: 2
  • Files created: 2
  • Files modified: 1
  • Audit attempts: 3 (all passed)

📋 Logbook updated: ai_files/logbooks/[filename]

💡 Commands:
  • Continue later: /ai-behavior:implement [filename]
  • Update progress: /ai-behavior:logbook-update [filename]
  • Close ticket: /ai-behavior:resolution-create [filename]
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| Implementer fails | Show error, offer retry or abort |
| Auditor fails | Skip audit, warn user, continue |
| File write fails | Show error, check permissions |
| Max retries exceeded | Offer accept/manual/abort options |

---

## Configuration Options (future)

Could be added to `user_pref.json`:

```json
{
  "implement_settings": {
    "max_audit_retries": 3,
    "auto_continue_next": false,
    "show_code_diff": true,
    "require_tests": false
  }
}
```
