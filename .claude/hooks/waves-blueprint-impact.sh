MSG="METACOGNITION TRIGGERED — Blueprint changed.\n\nYou may still update Waves artifacts (roadmaps, logbooks) — those are not blocked. Finish any pending artifact updates FIRST (e.g., update roadmaps to reflect blueprint changes).\n\nOnce all artifact updates are done, you are BLOCKED from code changes until you:\n1. Spawn a background Agent (run_in_background=true, model=sonnet) with the prompt below\n2. Update the active logbook recent_context with 'metacognition: blueprint impact delegated'\n\nThe gate will unblock after step 2. Continue working — the subagent analyzes in parallel.\n\nWhen the subagent returns:\n- If CRITICAL findings → classify as Level 4+, STOP, present to user immediately\n- If no critical findings → note in logbook and continue\n\n--- SUBAGENT PROMPT (use exactly as the prompt parameter) ---\nYou are a strategic advisor performing a cascading impact analysis for a product that uses the Waves framework.\n\nCONTEXT: The product BLUEPRINT was just modified. This is the most important artifact in the project — everything downstream (roadmaps, logbooks, implementation) derives from it. A change here can invalidate work already done or planned.\n\nREAD THESE FILES (all of them, completely):\n\nBlueprint (just modified):\n- $FILE\n\nRoadmaps (read each one):\n$ROADMAPS_PATHS\n\nLogbooks (read each one):\n$LOGBOOKS_PATHS\n\nAfter reading, perform a cascading impact analysis:\n\n1. INVALIDATED WORK — Compare the blueprint change with active roadmaps and logbooks:\n   - Are there roadmap phases planning work on capabilities that were REMOVED or CHANGED?\n   - Are there logbook objectives implementing something that no longer matches the blueprint?\n   - Are there decisions recorded in logbooks or roadmaps that are now CONTRADICTED by the blueprint change?\n   - Are there completed objectives whose output may need revision?\n\n2. COVERAGE GAPS — Check if the blueprint change creates new requirements:\n   - New capabilities that have NO roadmap phase covering them\n   - New flows or views that have NO logbook objectives planning their implementation\n   - New design principles that existing code may violate\n   - Dependencies between new and existing capabilities that aren't reflected in roadmap phase ordering\n\n3. OPPORTUNITIES — Does the blueprint change simplify anything?\n   - Can existing roadmap phases be consolidated or eliminated?\n   - Does the change make some planned work unnecessary?\n   - Does it open a faster path to the product hypothesis?\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n- If you find ANY impact: start with CRITICAL: then list each finding with the specific capability ID, phase number, or objective ID it affects. State what was invalidated and what action is needed.\n- If no impact: respond with exactly 'No critical findings.' and nothing else.\n\nBe specific and actionable. Under 400 words.\n--- END SUBAGENT PROMPT ---"
