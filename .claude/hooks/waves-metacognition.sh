  MSG="METACOGNITION — Objective completed in $LOGBOOK_NAME. BLOCKED until you delegate.\n\nFirst: update roadmap decisions with OBJECTIVE COMPLETION STATE from this logbook (achieved/in-progress/not-started/blocked counts).\n\nThen:\n1. Spawn background Agent (run_in_background=true, model=$META_MODEL) — COPY THE PROMPT BELOW EXACTLY. Do NOT rewrite, shorten, or paraphrase it.\n2. Write to any ai_files/ artifact — this clears the gate.\n\nWhen subagent returns: CRITICAL → stop and present. No findings → note and continue.\n\nPROMPT (copy as-is into the Agent prompt parameter):\nObjective completed: '$OBJ_CONTENT' in $LOGBOOK_NAME ($MAIN_COMPLETED/$MAIN_TOTAL main done). Read ALL these files completely:\n${BP:-blueprint not found}\n${ROADMAPS:-no roadmaps}\n${LOGBOOKS:-no logbooks}\n\nThink like a business advisor seeing a project snapshot. The team is focused on the immediate task — your job is to see what they cannot.\n1. BLOCKERS: upcoming objectives/capabilities that lack prerequisites. Missing accounts, APIs, infrastructure, legal, design assets? Information gaps that will cause rework? Ambiguities in flows/views?\n2. DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS: does the blueprint promise things the implementation reveals are incomplete? Missing flow steps? Capabilities that need splitting? Dependencies not visible during planning?\n3. EFFORT SAVINGS: external services that eliminate planned work? Architectural changes that simplify multiple phases? Phase reordering that unblocks parallel work? Capabilities to descope without affecting the hypothesis?\n\nReference capability IDs, phase numbers, objective IDs. Start with CRITICAL: if findings, or 'No critical findings.' if none. Under 400 words."
