  MSG="METACOGNITION TRIGGERED — Primary objective completed in $LOGBOOK_NAME.\n\nA mechanical progress note was written to the roadmap. Before continuing:\n\n1. Read this logbook's objectives (main + secondary) and their current statuses\n2. Update the roadmap decisions with a progress entry based on OBJECTIVE COMPLETION STATE: which objectives are achieved, in-progress, not started, blocked. This is the real state of the logbook projected to the roadmap.\n3. Update the logbook recent_context documenting what was done\n\nYou may still update Waves artifacts (roadmaps, logbooks, resolutions) — those are not blocked.\n\nOnce artifact updates are done, you are BLOCKED from code changes until you:\n4. Spawn a background Agent (run_in_background=true, model=sonnet) with the prompt below\n5. Update the logbook recent_context with 'metacognition: delegated to background analysis'\n\nThe gate will unblock after step 5. Continue with your next objective — the subagent analyzes in parallel.\n\nWhen the subagent returns:\n- If it reports CRITICAL findings → classify as Level 4+, STOP, and present to the user immediately\n- If it reports no critical findings → note in logbook and continue\n\n--- SUBAGENT PROMPT (use exactly as the prompt parameter) ---\nYou are a strategic advisor performing a metacognition analysis for a product development project that uses the Waves framework.\n\nCONTEXT: A primary objective was just completed in logbook '$LOGBOOK_NAME'. The objective was: '$OBJ_CONTENT'. The logbook state is: $MAIN_COMPLETED/$MAIN_TOTAL main objectives achieved.\n\nYour job is NOT to review code. Your job is to think like a business advisor who just received a snapshot of the project and must identify things the development team cannot see because they are focused on the immediate task.\n\nREAD THESE FILES (all of them, completely):\n- Blueprint: ${BP:-not found}\n- Roadmaps: ${ROADMAPS:-none found}\n- Logbooks: ${LOGBOOKS:-none found}\n\nAfter reading, analyze for THREE things:\n\n1. BLOCKERS — Look at the upcoming objectives, phases, and capabilities that are NOT yet implemented. For each, ask: does the project have everything it needs to achieve this? Look for:\n   - Missing prerequisites (e.g., blueprint promises AppStore deployment but no Apple Developer account is planned anywhere)\n   - Information gaps (e.g., a capability requires an API integration but no API credentials or documentation is referenced)\n   - Ambiguities that will cause rework (e.g., a flow references a 'user dashboard' but no view or design for it exists in the blueprint)\n   - Infrastructure assumptions (e.g., blueprint wants real-time features but no WebSocket or push notification infrastructure is planned)\n\n2. DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS — Compare what the blueprint PROMISES with what the implementation REVEALS. Look for:\n   - Flows that are missing steps (the implementation shows a step is needed that the blueprint doesn't have)\n   - Capabilities that should be split (too much scope in one capability based on what implementation revealed)\n   - Dependencies that weren't visible during planning but are now obvious\n   - Design principles that are being violated by the current implementation approach\n\n3. EFFORT SAVINGS — Think about the blueprint's mission, vision, and hypothesis. Is there:\n   - An external service, API, or library that would eliminate planned work?\n   - An architectural change that would make multiple upcoming phases simpler?\n   - A reordering of phases that would reduce dependencies and unblock parallel work?\n   - A capability that could be descoped without affecting the hypothesis?\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n- If you find ANY of the three: start with CRITICAL: then list each finding with the specific capability ID, phase number, or objective ID it affects. Explain WHY it matters and WHAT the team should do about it.\n- If you find NOTHING critical: respond with exactly 'No critical findings.' and nothing else.\n\nBe specific and actionable. Under 400 words.\n--- END SUBAGENT PROMPT ---"
