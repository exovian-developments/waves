  MSG="METACOGNITION TRIGGERED — Roadmap phase completed ($WAVE).\n\nYou may still update Waves artifacts (logbooks, resolutions) — those are not blocked. Finish any pending artifact updates FIRST.\n\nOnce all artifact updates are done, you are BLOCKED from code changes until you:\n1. Spawn a background Agent (run_in_background=true, model=$META_MODEL) with the prompt below\n2. Update the active logbook recent_context with 'metacognition: phase audit delegated'\n\nThe gate will unblock after step 2. Continue working — the subagent analyzes in parallel.\n\nWhen the subagent returns:\n- If CRITICAL findings → classify as Level 4+, STOP, present to user immediately\n- If no critical findings → note in logbook and continue\n\n--- SUBAGENT PROMPT (use exactly as the prompt parameter) ---\nYou are a strategic advisor performing a phase completion audit for a product that uses the Waves framework.\n\nCONTEXT: Phase in wave '$WAVE' was just completed. This is a natural checkpoint — the team is about to start the next phase. Your job is to ensure the next phase starts on solid ground.\n\nREAD THESE FILES (all of them, completely):\n\nBlueprint:\n- ${BP:-not found}\n\nRoadmaps (the completed phase is in $FILE, but read ALL for cross-wave impact):\n$ROADMAPS_PATHS\n\nLogbooks (read each one):\n$LOGBOOKS_PATHS\n\nAfter reading, perform a strategic audit:\n\n1. READINESS CHECK FOR NEXT PHASE — Look at the next phase's milestones and objectives:\n   - Does the project have all prerequisites to start? (Infrastructure, accounts, credentials, APIs, design assets, legal requirements)\n   - Are there decisions from the completed phase that MUST be resolved before proceeding?\n   - Are there logbook objectives that were abandoned or left incomplete that the next phase depends on?\n   - Are there ambiguities in the next phase's milestones that will cause confusion during implementation?\n\n2. BLUEPRINT ALIGNMENT — Compare what was accomplished with what the blueprint promises:\n   - Which blueprint capabilities advanced during this phase?\n   - Are any capabilities falling behind or being implemented differently than designed?\n   - Do the design principles still hold, or has the implementation revealed they need revision?\n   - Is the product hypothesis still supported by the direction of implementation?\n\n3. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES — Think about the big picture:\n   - Can upcoming phases be reordered to reduce dependencies or enable parallel work?\n   - Did this phase produce something reusable (a pattern, library, or tool) that saves effort later?\n   - Is there a faster path to validating the product hypothesis than what the roadmap currently plans?\n   - Should any planned capabilities be descoped based on what was learned?\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n- If you find ANY critical findings: start with CRITICAL: then list each with phase numbers, capability IDs, and objective IDs. State what's at risk and what action is needed.\n- If no critical findings: respond with exactly 'No critical findings. Phase $WAVE audit complete.' and nothing else.\n\nBe specific and actionable. Under 400 words.\n--- END SUBAGENT PROMPT ---"
