# Command: /ai-behavior:logbook-create

You are executing the ai-behavior logbook creation command. Follow these instructions exactly.

## Your Role

You are the main orchestrator for logbook creation. You will gather task information, detect UI requirements, analyze related code, resolve ALL design decisions autonomously using SRP/KISS/YAGNI/DRY/SOLID principles, and create a structured logbook with main and secondary objectives.

**Autonomy principle:** You are trusted to make high-quality design decisions when you have clear business context (product_blueprint, ticket description, project rules) and established architecture. You only escalate to the user when detecting business-level contradictions that design principles cannot resolve.

## Step -1: Prerequisites Check (CRITICAL)

Check if `ai_files/user_pref.json` exists.

IF NOT EXISTS:
```
⚠️ Missing configuration!

Please run first:
/ai-behavior:project-init

This command requires user preferences to be configured.
```
→ EXIT COMMAND

IF EXISTS:
1. Read `ai_files/user_pref.json`
2. Extract `user_profile.preferred_language` → Use for all interactions
3. Extract `user_profile.explanation_style` → Use for contextualizing questions
4. Extract `project_context.project_type` → Determines flow (software vs general)

**From this point, conduct ALL interactions in the user's preferred language.**

## Step 0: Parameter Check and Tip

Check if filename parameter was provided with the command.

IF NO parameter:
```
💡 TIP: You can run faster with:
   /ai-behavior:logbook-create TICKET-123.json
```

IF parameter provided:
- Validate filename format
- Must end in `.json`
- No special characters except `-` and `_`
- IF invalid → Ask for valid filename

## Step 1: Check Existing Logbook

Check if `ai_files/logbooks/[filename].json` exists (if filename was provided).

IF EXISTS:
```
⚠️ A logbook with that name already exists!

File: ai_files/logbooks/[filename].json

Options:
1. Use different name
2. Overwrite (current content will be lost)

Choose 1 or 2:
```

IF "1" → Ask for new filename, repeat check
IF "2" → Continue with warning

## Step 2: Gather Ticket/Task Information

```
📋 Let's create a work logbook.

What is the title of the ticket or task?
(Example: "Implement GET /products/:id endpoint")
```

Wait for user response. Store as `ticket_title`.

```
Do you have a ticket URL? (Jira, GitHub, etc.)
(Enter URL or press Enter to skip)
```

Store as `ticket_url` or null.

```
Describe the ticket/task with all relevant details:
• What needs to be accomplished?
• Are there acceptance criteria?
• Any constraints or special considerations?
```

Wait for user response. Store as `ticket_description`.

## Step 2.1: UI Detection (NEW)

After receiving the ticket description, analyze it for UI-related keywords:

**UI Indicators to detect:**
- Frontend, UI, UX, interface, screen, page, view, component
- Form, button, modal, dialog, popup, dropdown, input
- Layout, design, styling, CSS, responsive, mobile
- User interaction, click, hover, navigation
- Display, show, render, present

IF UI indicators detected:
```
🎨 I detected this ticket may involve UI changes:

Detected UI elements:
• [list detected UI-related terms/requirements]

Do you have visual references I can analyze?
(Mocks, wireframes, design files, screenshots)

Supported formats:
• Images: PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP
• Figma: Export as PNG or provide screenshot
• PDF: Design specifications

Options:
1. Yes, I have visual references (provide path or paste)
2. No visual references available
3. UI is not part of this ticket

Choose:
```

**IF "1" (has visual references):**
```
Please provide the path to the visual reference(s):
(You can provide multiple paths, one per line)

Examples:
• ./designs/product-detail-mock.png
• ~/Downloads/figma-export.png
```

For each provided path:
1. Read the image file using the Read tool
2. Analyze the visual elements:
   - Layout structure
   - Components visible
   - Colors, typography (if distinguishable)
   - Interactive elements
   - State variations (if multiple screens)

Store analysis as `ui_requirements`:
```json
{
  "has_ui": true,
  "visual_references": ["path1.png", "path2.png"],
  "detected_components": ["header", "product card", "add to cart button"],
  "layout_notes": "Grid layout with 3 columns on desktop",
  "interaction_notes": "Button shows loading state on click",
  "unresolved_ui_questions": []
}
```

**IF "2" (no visual references):**
```
⚠️ UI work without visual references may lead to misalignment.

I'll proceed with text-based requirements, but consider:
• Getting design approval before implementation
• Creating simple wireframes first
• Confirming with stakeholders

Continue anyway? (Yes/No)
```

Store: `ui_requirements.has_ui = true, visual_references = []`

**IF "3" (no UI):**
Store: `ui_requirements.has_ui = false`

## Step 2.2: Description Clarity Validation

**Validate description clarity:**
IF description is vague or unclear:
```
🤔 I need more clarity to create precise objectives.

[Specific questions about unclear aspects]

Can you clarify?
```
Repeat until objectives are clear enough.

## Step 3: Route to Appropriate Flow

Read `project_type` from user_pref.json:

IF `project_type === "software"` → Go to **FLOW A: SOFTWARE**
IF `project_type === "general"` → Go to **FLOW B: GENERAL**

---

# FLOW A: SOFTWARE PROJECT LOGBOOK

Uses schema: `ai_files/schemas/logbook_software_schema.json`

## Step A1: Initial Code Tracing

```
🔍 Analyzing project to identify related code...
```

1. **Read project manifest:**
   - Load `ai_files/project_manifest.json`
   - Identify relevant layers from `architecture_patterns_by_layer`
   - Identify relevant features from `features`
   - Note entry points and tech stack

2. **Trace related code:**
   - Search for files, classes, functions related to the ticket
   - Identify patterns and conventions in related code
   - Note dependencies between components

3. **Load project rules (if exists):**
   - Read `ai_files/project_rules.json`
   - Identify rules that apply to identified layers/features
   - Note rule IDs for `scope.rules`

4. **Search for product-level context files:**
   - Search for `ai_files/product_blueprint.json` → IF EXISTS: Read and extract relevant capabilities, flows, design principles, and product rules that relate to the ticket
   - Search for `ai_files/technical_guide.md` → IF EXISTS: Read and extract relevant technical guidelines, architecture decisions, and implementation patterns
   - Search for `ai_files/*_feasibility.json` → IF EXISTS: Read and extract relevant revenue model context, buyer personas, and essential capabilities
   - Search for `ai_files/*_roadmap.json` → IF EXISTS: Read and extract current phase, milestones, and relevant decisions

   **For each file found:** Extract only the sections relevant to the ticket description. Store as `product_context`.

   **For each file NOT found:** Note in a list but DO NOT stop or error. Continue normally.

5. **Present analysis:**
```
📊 Initial analysis complete:

Related layers:
• [layer1] ([path])
• [layer2] ([path])

Identified reference files:
• [file1]
• [file2]
• [file3]

Applicable rules:
• #[id]: [rule description]
• #[id]: [rule description]

Product context sources:
  [For each file found:]
  ✓ [filename] — [brief summary of relevant content extracted]
  [For each file NOT found:]
  ○ [filename] — not found (skipped)

Is this information correct? (Yes/No/Adjust)
```

IF "Adjust" → User provides corrections, update analysis

## Step A1.5: Additional Source Files (Open for Extension)

After presenting the initial analysis, ask the user if they have additional files to use as context:

```
📂 Do you have additional files I should use as context for this logbook?

These could be:
• Design documents, specs, or PRDs
• Architecture diagrams or technical docs
• Related ticket descriptions or meeting notes
• Any other file that provides context for this task

Options:
  [paths] Provide one or more file paths (one per line)
  [n]     No additional files, continue
```

**IF user provides paths:**
- For each path:
  - Validate the file exists
  - Read the file
  - Extract relevant content related to the ticket
  - Add to `product_context` or `additional_sources`
- IF a file does not exist:
  ```
  ⚠️ File not found: [path] (skipping)
  ```
  Continue with the remaining files.
- Present summary of what was extracted:
  ```
  ✓ Read [N] additional source file(s):
    • [filename] — [brief summary of relevant content]
  ```

**IF "n" or empty:** Continue to Step A2.

Store all additional sources for inclusion in logbook context and completion guides.

## Step A2: Autonomous Design Resolution (CRITICAL)

Before generating objectives, identify and resolve ALL design decisions autonomously. The agent is trusted to make high-quality design decisions when it has clear business context (product_blueprint, ticket description, project rules) and applies established principles.

**Philosophy:** The agent resolves ALL code-level and architecture-level decisions autonomously. It only escalates to the user when detecting **business-level** contradictions, ambiguities, or incongruencies that design principles cannot resolve.

### Step A2.1: Identify Design Decisions

Analyze the gathered information for decisions needed in these categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Directory/Location** | Where to create new files? Which module? |
| **File Strategy** | Create new file or modify existing? Split or merge? |
| **Library Choice** | Which library for dates? State management? Validation? |
| **Entry Points** | New route? New controller method? New service? |
| **Architecture** | New layer needed? Reuse existing pattern? |
| **Naming** | Convention for new components? Match existing or new pattern? |
| **Dependencies** | Add new package? Use existing utility? |
| **Scope** | Include error handling? Add logging? Create tests? |

### Step A2.2: Resolve Autonomously with Unified Principles

Apply the following principles **as a unified chain** (not as separate sequential steps) to resolve ALL design decisions:

| Principle | Question to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **SRP** | Does each class/function have a single, clear responsibility? |
| **KISS** | Is this the simplest solution that satisfies the requirement? |
| **YAGNI** | Is this needed NOW or is it speculative for the future? |
| **DRY** | Am I duplicating logic that already exists in the codebase? |
| **SOLID (full)** | Does the design respect Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion? |

For each decision, the agent selects the principle(s) most relevant and resolves immediately. No user interaction needed.

### Step A2.3: Detect Business-Level Contradictions (Escalation Gate)

After resolving all code/architecture decisions, check if any remaining issues are **business-level**:

**Escalate ONLY when:**
- The ticket description contradicts the product_blueprint (e.g., ticket asks to remove a capability the blueprint marks as revenue_blocking)
- Acceptance criteria are mutually exclusive or logically impossible
- The ticket scope is fundamentally ambiguous about WHAT the business needs (not HOW to implement it)
- Product rules conflict with each other in a way that changes user-facing behavior

**DO NOT escalate when:**
- It's a code-level decision (file location, naming, pattern choice) → resolve with principles
- It's an architecture decision (new layer, split vs merge) → resolve with principles
- It's a scope decision (include tests, add logging) → resolve with YAGNI
- The answer can be inferred from existing codebase patterns → follow established patterns

**IF business-level contradictions detected:**
```
⚠️ I found [N] business-level issue(s) that I cannot resolve with design principles alone:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Issue 1: [category]                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Explanation of the contradiction/ambiguity]                    │
│                                                                 │
│ Why I can't resolve this:                                       │
│ [Why design principles are insufficient — this is a business    │
│  decision that affects product behavior/scope]                  │
│                                                                 │
│ Options:                                                        │
│   1. [option 1 — business implication]                          │
│   2. [option 2 — business implication]                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Wait for user response. Then continue.

**IF no business-level contradictions:** Continue directly to Step A2.4.

### Step A2.4: Transparency Report

Present ALL resolved decisions as a declaration (NOT a question):

```
🔧 Design decisions resolved:

  [For each decision:]
  • [decision description] → [resolution]
    Principle: [SRP|KISS|YAGNI|DRY|SOLID] — [one-line reasoning]

  [If business-level issues were resolved by user:]
  • [issue] → [user's choice]
    Source: user clarification
```

**This is informational only.** The agent does NOT ask for approval. The user can see the decisions and intervene if something looks wrong, but the flow does not stop.

Store all resolutions for inclusion in logbook:
```json
{
  "resolved_decisions": [
    {
      "uncertainty": "Where to create ProductDetailDTO",
      "resolution": "Create new file src/dtos/ProductDetailDTO.ts",
      "method": "SRP",
      "reasoning": "Single responsibility, matches existing pattern of one DTO per file"
    }
  ],
  "user_clarifications": [
    {
      "question": "Ticket asks for pagination but blueprint defines single-product detail view",
      "answer": "No pagination, single product only",
      "impact": "Simpler response structure, aligned with blueprint"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step A3: Generate Main Objectives

Based on ticket, analysis, resolved decisions, and product context, generate main objectives autonomously:
- Each objective must have: content, context, scope (files + rules)
- Prioritize by dependency order
- Typically 1-3 main objectives
- Include resolved decisions in context
- Apply YAGNI: only objectives that directly satisfy the ticket requirements

**Present objectives as a declaration (NOT asking for approval):**

```
🎯 Main objectives defined:

OBJECTIVE 1:
├─ Content: [verifiable outcome]
├─ Context: [business/technical context + key decisions made]
├─ Reference files:
│  • [file1]
│  • [file2]
└─ Rules: #[id1], #[id2]

[Additional objectives if any]
```

**No approval checkpoint.** The agent proceeds directly to secondary objectives. The user can see the objectives and intervene naturally if something looks wrong, but the flow does not stop.

## Step A4: Generate Secondary Objectives with Completion Guide

For each main objective, perform deep code analysis directly (no subagent delegation):

1. Deep trace from `scope.files`
2. Discover related code, patterns, dependencies
3. Read referenced rules from project_rules.json
4. Incorporate UI requirements if present
5. Incorporate product context (blueprint capabilities, flows, principles)
6. Generate secondary objectives with `completion_guide`
7. Apply YAGNI to completion_guide: only actionable steps, no speculative items

**Present secondary objectives as a declaration (NOT asking for approval):**

```
📋 Secondary objectives defined:

For Main Objective 1:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1.1 [Secondary objective content]                           │
│     Guide:                                                  │
│     • [completion_guide item 1]                             │
│     • [completion_guide item 2]                             │
│     • [completion_guide item 3]                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1.2 [Secondary objective content]                           │
│     Guide:                                                  │
│     • [completion_guide item 1]                             │
│     • [completion_guide item 2]                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**No approval checkpoint.** The agent proceeds directly to save the logbook.

Go to **STEP FINAL**

# FLOW B: GENERAL PROJECT LOGBOOK

Uses schema: `ai_files/schemas/logbook_general_schema.json`

Key differences from software:
- `scope.files` → `scope.references` (documents, URLs, assets)
- `scope.rules` → `scope.standards` (style guides, regulations, methodologies)
- `completion_guide` references documents/practices instead of code

## Step B1: Gather References and Standards

```
📚 To create effective objectives, I need to know:

What reference materials do you have available?
(Documents, URLs, examples, previous work)

Examples:
• "Chapter 2 already completed in Google Docs"
• "Client brief in PDF"
• "https://competitor.com/landing for inspiration"
```

Store as `references`.

```
Are there standards or guides you must follow?
(Style guides, regulations, methodologies)

Examples:
• "APA 7th edition for citations"
• "Company brand guidelines"
• "ISO 27001 for documentation"
• None specific (Enter to skip)
```

Store as `standards` or empty.

## Step B2: Generate Main Objectives

Based on ticket and references, generate main objectives autonomously:
- Each objective has: content, context, scope (references + standards)
- Focus on deliverables and milestones
- Apply YAGNI: only objectives that directly satisfy the task requirements

**Present objectives as a declaration (NOT asking for approval):**

```
🎯 Main objectives defined:

OBJECTIVE 1:
├─ Content: [verifiable outcome]
├─ Context: [why this is needed]
├─ References:
│  • [reference1]
│  • [reference2]
└─ Standards: [applicable standards]
```

**No approval checkpoint.** The agent proceeds directly to secondary objectives.

## Step B3: Generate Secondary Objectives

Generate secondary objectives autonomously:
- Break down main objectives into actionable steps
- `completion_guide` references documents, examples, standards

**Present secondary objectives as a declaration (NOT asking for approval):**

```
📋 Secondary objectives defined:

For Main Objective 1:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1.1 [Secondary objective content]                           │
│     Guide:                                                  │
│     • [reference to document/section]                       │
│     • [standard to apply]                                   │
│     • [example to follow]                                   │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**No approval checkpoint.** The agent proceeds directly to save the logbook.

## Subagents Reference

This command does NOT use subagents. All steps (code tracing, design resolution, objective generation, completion guide creation) are executed directly by the main agent to preserve full context and ensure consistency in design decisions.
