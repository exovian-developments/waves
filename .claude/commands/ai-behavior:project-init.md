🌍 What language do you prefer for our conversations?

Examples: English, Español, Português, Français, Deutsch, 日本語

Type your preferred language:
```

Wait for user response. Store as `preferred_language`. Normalize to ISO code if possible (es, en, pt, etc.).

Confirm: "✓ Language set to: [language]"

**From this point, conduct ALL interactions in the user's chosen language.**

## Step 1: Check Existing Configuration

Check if `ai_files/user_pref.json` exists.

IF EXISTS, ask in user's language:
```
⚠️ A configuration already exists in this project!

Options:
1. Stop (keep existing)
2. Continue (overwrite)

Choose 1 or 2:
```

IF user chooses 1 → Exit with message about using /ai-behavior:user-pref-update instead.
IF user chooses 2 → Continue.

## Step 2: Command Explanation

Display in user's language:
```
📘 Command: /ai-behavior:project-init

This command configures your essential preferences for working with ai-behavior.
I'll ask you 5 questions to set up how I interact with you and understand your project.

Continue? (Yes/No)
```

IF No → Exit.

## Step 3: Question 1 - Name + Role

Ask in user's language:
```
👤 What is your name and role in this project?

Example: 'Alex - Senior Frontend Developer'
         'María - Lead Researcher'
         'João - Product Manager'
```

Parse response:
- Try to split by "-", ":", or similar
- Extract `name` and `technical_background`
- If role not detected, ask follow-up: "What is your role or specialty?"

## Step 4: Question 2 - Project Type

Ask in user's language:
```
🎯 What type of project is this?

1. Software project - Application, API, system, code
2. General project - Research, business, creative, academic, other

Choose 1 or 2:
```

Store: `project_type = "software"` (if 1) or `"general"` (if 2)

## Step 5: Question 3 - Project Familiarity

Ask in user's language:
```
📚 How familiar are you with this project?

1. I know it well - I understand its structure and technologies
2. It's new to me - I need to explore it, understand it, or I'm creating it from scratch

Choose 1 or 2:
```

Store: `is_project_known_by_user = true` (if 1) or `false` (if 2)

## Step 6: Question 4 - Communication Tone

Ask in user's language:
```
💬 How do you prefer I communicate with you?

Examples:
• 'Professional' - Respectful and focused
• 'Friendly with humor' - Casual with touches of sarcasm
• 'Direct' - No fluff, straight to the point
• Or describe your preference in your own words

Type your preference:
```

Map to enum: `formal`, `neutral`, `friendly`, `friendly_with_sarcasm`, `funny`, `strict`
Use closest match or store as custom.

## Step 7: Question 5 - Explanation Style

Ask in user's language:
```
📚 What level of detail do you prefer in explanations?

Examples:
• 'Direct' - Short answers without extra explanations
• 'Balanced' - Explanation with relevant technical context
• 'Teaching mode' - Explain every step in depth
• Or describe your preference

Type your preference:
```

Map to enum values from schema.

## Step 8: Generate Configuration

Display in user's language:
```
⚙️ Generating your configuration...

The following preferences are set with default values.
You can adjust them later with: /ai-behavior:user-pref-update

📋 Default values applied:

LLM Behavior:
  • explain_before_answering: true
  • ask_before_assuming: true
  • suggest_multiple_options: true
  • allow_self_correction: true
  • persistent_personality: true
  • feedback_loop_enabled: true

User Profile:
  • emoji_usage: true
  • learning_style: explicative

Output Preferences:
  • format_code_with_comments: true
  • highlight_gotchas: true
```

## Step 9: Create user_pref.json

Read the schema from `ai_files/schemas/user_pref_schema.json` to understand the structure.

Create `ai_files/user_pref.json` with:
- User's answers from questions 1-5
- Default values for all other fields
- Proper JSON structure matching the schema

## Step 10: Update or Create CLAUDE.md

Check if `CLAUDE.md` exists in project root.

IF EXISTS:
- Prepend this content at the top:
```markdown
# User Preferences

Read and follow user preferences from: ai_files/user_pref.json

---

```

IF NOT EXISTS:
- Create `CLAUDE.md` with just the preferences reference.

## Step 11: Success Message

Display in user's language:
```
