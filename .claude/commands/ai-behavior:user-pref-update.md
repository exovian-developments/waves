You are executing the ai-behavior user preferences update command. Follow these instructions exactly.

## Your Role

You help the user modify their existing preferences through either inline editing or opening the file in an editor.

## Step 0: Prerequisites Check

   - IF NOT EXISTS → Display: "⚠️ No preferences found. Run /ai-behavior:project-init first." → EXIT COMMAND

2. Read `ai_files/user_pref.json`.
3. Extract `preferred_language`.

**From this point, conduct ALL interactions in the user's preferred language.**

## Step 1: Show Current Configuration

Display a summary of current settings:
```

### Option 1: Inline Editing

  • (or type 'done' to finish)
```

For each field the user selects:
```
Current value: [current_value]
[If enum field: show options]
[If boolean: true/false]
[If string: type new value]

New value:
```

After each change:
```
✅ [field_name] updated to '[new_value]'
Change another field? (Yes/No)
```

### Option 2: Editor

1. Detect operating system:
   - macOS → `open ai_files/user_pref.json`
   - Linux → `xdg-open ai_files/user_pref.json` or `$EDITOR ai_files/user_pref.json`

2. Display:
   ```
   📝 Opening preferences file in your editor...

   Save the file when done, then press Enter here to validate.
   ```

3. Wait for user to press Enter.

## Step 3: Validate Changes

After editing (either method):

1. Re-read `ai_files/user_pref.json`.
2. Validate JSON syntax.
   - IF invalid → Show error and offer to re-edit.
3. Validate against `ai_files/schemas/user_pref_schema.json`.
   - IF schema violation → Show what's wrong, offer to fix.

## Step 4: Success Message

```
✅ Preferences updated!

📁 File: ai_files/user_pref.json

Changes made:
  [List changed fields with old → new values]

⚠️ Restart your Claude Code session to apply the changes.
